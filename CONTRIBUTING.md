## Development Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-trading-analytics.git
   cd real-time-trading-analytics
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Coding Standards

We follow these coding standards to maintain consistency and readability:

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper interfaces and types for components and data structures
- Avoid using `any` type when possible

### Components

- Create small, focused components (< 200 lines)
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the component file structure:
  ```
  src/components/[domain]/[ComponentName].tsx
  ```
- Export components as named exports when possible

### Hooks

- Prefix custom hooks with `use`
- Keep hooks focused on specific functionality
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` for performance optimization
- Extract complex logic from components into custom hooks

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use shadcn/ui components when possible
- Follow responsive design principles

### Naming Conventions

- Use `PascalCase` for component names
- Use `camelCase` for variables, functions, and instances
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Create an issue or feature request**
   - Describe the problem or feature clearly
   - Include any relevant context or screenshots

2. **Fork and create a branch**
   - Fork the repository
   - Create a branch with a descriptive name:
     ```
     feat/add-new-chart-type
     fix/sync-error-handling
     docs/update-architecture-diagram
     ```

3. **Make changes**
   - Follow the coding standards
   - Write clear, concise commit messages
   - Reference the issue number in commits

4. **Test your changes**
   - Ensure all existing tests pass
   - Add new tests for new functionality
   - Test manually against the testing guidelines

5. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Fill out the PR template
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Link the related issue
   - Request a review from maintainers

## Testing Guidelines

### Core Functionality Testing

- Verify that all chart types render correctly
- Test dashboard data loading and display
- Check that filtering and sorting works as expected

### Real-Time Feature Testing

Before submitting a PR that affects real-time features, ensure you've tested:

1. **Connection Management**
   - Initial connection establishment
   - Recovery after connection loss
   - Manual reconnection behavior

2. **Data Synchronization**
   - Auto-sync functionality
   - Manual sync triggers
   - Data consistency across components

3. **Status Indication**
   - Connection status indicators
   - Loading states
   - Error handling and user feedback

4. **Integration Points**
   - TradingView integration
   - Binance data flow
   - Twitter/social data integration

5. **Performance**
   - Memory usage during extended sessions
   - CPU load during high-frequency updates
   - Response time for user interactions

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for functions, hooks, and components
- Document complex algorithms or business logic
- Keep inline comments focused and relevant

### User Documentation

- Update README.md with new features
- Add usage examples for new components
- Document configuration options

## Architecture Diagrams

When making significant architectural changes:

1. **Update the diagrams**
   - Modify SVG files in the `/docs` directory
   - Follow the existing color coding and visual language
   - See [diagrams.md](./docs/diagrams.md) for details

2. **Document the changes**
   - Explain why changes were made
   - Update the diagram legend if needed
   - Reference new components or data flows

3. **Tools for diagram editing**
   - Use vector graphics editors like Inkscape, Adobe Illustrator, or Figma
   - Export as SVG with preserved text
   - Optimize SVGs for web
