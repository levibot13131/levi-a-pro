  - [ ] Check responsiveness at different screen sizes
  - [ ] Verify toolbar controls work correctly
  - [ ] Test data loading states appear appropriately

- [ ] **Real-Time Data Updates**
  - [ ] Confirm charts update when new data arrives
  - [ ] Test behavior during data gaps or delays
  - [ ] Verify smooth transitions between data points

- [ ] **Chart Interactions**
  - [ ] Test zoom functionality
  - [ ] Verify hover tooltips display correct information
  - [ ] Check that pattern recognition highlights appear correctly

- [ ] **Multiple Timeframe Support**
  - [ ] Test switching between timeframes
  - [ ] Verify data loads correctly for each timeframe
  - [ ] Check that timeframe state is preserved when returning to chart

## Error Handling & Recovery

- [ ] **Network Failures**
  - [ ] Test app behavior during temporary network loss
  - [ ] Verify reconnection attempts occur
  - [ ] Check that data resumes flowing after reconnection

- [ ] **API Errors**
  - [ ] Test handling of 4xx errors from APIs
  - [ ] Verify behavior with 5xx server errors
  - [ ] Check timeout handling

- [ ] **Data Inconsistency**
  - [ ] Test behavior with partial or corrupt data
  - [ ] Verify error boundaries prevent app crashes
  - [ ] Check fallback to cached data when appropriate

- [ ] **User Feedback**
  - [ ] Verify toast notifications appear for important events
  - [ ] Test that error messages are clear and actionable
  - [ ] Check loading indicators display at appropriate times

## Cross-Device & Performance Testing

- [ ] **Responsive Design**
  - [ ] Test on desktop (various window sizes)

  - [ ] Log connection establishment and termination
  - [ ] Track reconnection attempts and success rate
  - [ ] Monitor data throughput for WebSocket connections

- [ ] **Error Logging**
  - [ ] Implement structured error logging
  - [ ] Capture stack traces for unexpected errors
  - [ ] Log user context with errors when appropriate
  - [ ] Set up alerts for critical error thresholds

### Performance Monitoring

- [ ] **Key Metrics Tracking**
  - [ ] Monitor page load times
  - [ ] Track time to interactive for critical pages
  - [ ] Measure API response times
  - [ ] Monitor memory and CPU usage
